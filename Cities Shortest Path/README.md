This repository contains the solution code for the homework given by Bora Doken and Muhammed Yasin AdÄ±yaman for the EHB 208E course.

## Solution Details
- Author: Javad Ibrahimli
- School No: 040210932
- Date 26 March 2023

## Files
The solution code is contained in a single C file named main.c.

## Usage
The solution code can be compiled and run using a C compiler such as gcc.


```bash
  gcc main.c -o output
  ./output
```

## Code Structure
The solution code defines two structs: myDict and Node. The myDict struct represents a dictionary with a linked list implementation, while the Node struct represents a node in a two-dimensional linked list.

## The solution code includes the following functions:

- addmyDict: Adds a new node to a linked list of myDict structs
- addNode: Adds a new node to a two-dimensional linked list
- print_matrix: Prints the two-dimensional linked list to a file
- countZeros: Counts the number of zeros in the two-dimensional linked list
- checkforDublicate: Updates the count of current nodes and adds a new node to the dictionary.

## Execution Results
The execution results of the solution code are written to the output file named output.txt.

## Additional Notes
The solution code uses the header files stdio.h, stdlib.h, and string.h to provide various input/output, memory allocation, and string manipulation functions to the program.
