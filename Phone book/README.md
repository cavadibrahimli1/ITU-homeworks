# Phone Book


The programming steps are summarized below:
1. Write a simple program that reads a (name surname) typed by user. The name can be
up to 100 characters long. Write a function that takes the name and prints “Hello name
surname!” (with the typed name substituted for name surname):
```
struct stComplex{
 int re, im;
};
typedef struct stComplex Complex; 
```
2. Using this structure, write a program that reads an array of complex numbers until
0+0j is entered as an element and print the element of the array with maximum
absolute value. For this reason, write a function called abs(c) that returns the absolute
value of a complex number, c. Note that the absolute value of a number c = x + j y is
defined as |c|=square root(x^2+y^2) . The maximum number of elements that can be entered
should be determined by a compiler constant SIZE.  


### Homework Deliverables
A sequential access file "phonebook.txt" has 10 records, each of which contains
FIRST NAME, LAST NAME, and PHONE NUMBER of a person. Write a C MAIN
function to accomplish the following tasks.
- Declare an array of structures which will hold the records of "phonebook.txt" file.
- Store "phonebook.txt" file into the array of structures.
- Search the array of structures for the FIRST and the LAST NAME of a particular
person which will be read from the standard input.
- If the search is succesful, it will print FIRST NAME, LAST NAME and PHONE
NUMBER of the person being searched, otherwise, it will print "NOT FOUND".
